# Krakatoa
_A boilerplate WordPress theme by [Dillon Brickhouse](https://drbrickhouse.com/)_

## Is This Theme for You?
It is important to understand that Krakatoa is, by definition, a power-user's theme. It includes the basic tools needed for an experienced developer to build a highly-customized website quickly and easily. However, it is geared toward developers who want little cruft in their code. Therefore, this theme foregoes any pre-defined UX components beyond those provided by Bootstrap. There is no visual editor included. It is expected that developers will use child themes and modify files to overwrite the defaults as best fits their needs.

## Installation
You may install this theme either by zipping the folder and uploading to the WordPress theme selector or by uploading all files to your themes folder via FTP.
